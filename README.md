# Create-Machine-Learning-Multi-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predict-Used-Cars-Price
- This repository demonstartes some common exploratory data analysis methods and techniques using python. The dataset has been taken from csv file shared with us the aim is to get all insights and build Linear regression machine learning model with Accuracy r2 score must be more than 75%.
- Project Tasks
- We will go through below tasks in this project before linear regression model:

- Task 1: Definining Exploratory Data Analysis with an overview of the whole project .

- Task 2: Importing libraries and Exploring the Dataset.

- Task 3: Remove dublicated and not used information from Dataset

- Task 4: Handle the NaN values in Dataset

- Task 5: adjust data type for attributes has wrong data type to improve analysis.

- Task 6: Create Brand column and check if there is strong releation with Price and data are distrbuted good in this dataset.

- Task 7: Deal with wrong data before visualize it.

- Task 8: Creating visual methods to analyze the data.

- Task 9: Investigate outliers in each column to decide how we will deal with
